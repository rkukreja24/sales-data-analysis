# 🛒 Sales Data Analysis Project

This project explores and analyzes a retail sales dataset to extract actionable business insights. Alongside the technical work, I used [Monday.com](https://monday.com) to create a structured project roadmap and record my progress throughout, demonstrating end-to-end project management skills.

## 📂 Dataset Source

## 🎯 Project Planning & Management

- Used **Monday.com** to:
  - Build a detailed **project roadmap** before starting
  - Break down tasks into phases (Data Cleaning, EDA, Modeling, Reporting)
  - Set goals and track progress
  - Record learnings and blockers to reflect on improvements

This approach helped ensure clarity, time management, and focus throughout the project lifecycle.
